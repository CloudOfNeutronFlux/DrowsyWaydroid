        Welcome to Grit Gate. I am Otho, Barathrum's steward. I apologize for the manner of our introduction, but we must take precautions. Qud is a very unforgiving place.

        You demonstrate tremendous promise to have returned from Golgotha with such inexperience. Take this firearm as your reward. It bears the mark of our finest gunsmith, Sparafucile. Take this bracelet, as well.

        Return when you are ready to discuss the signal.

        I am pleased to see that you've returned with the waydroid, though you still know little of the dangers you bear. Take this firearm as your reward. It bears the mark of our finest gunsmith, Sparafucile.
